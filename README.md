#Rice Disease and Pest Prediction

Overview

This project contains a machine learning-based system for predicting diseases and pests affecting rice crops. The project aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early detection and management of rice diseases and pests, improving crop yield and reducing losses. The system leverages data such as images, environmental conditions, and historical records to predict potential threats to rice crops.

Features





Disease Prediction: Identifies common rice diseases (e.g., blast, sheath blight, bacterial leaf blight) using machine learning models.



Pest Detection: Detects prevalent rice pests (e.g., brown plant hopper, stem borer) through image analysis or environmental data.



Data Processing: Includes scripts for preprocessing datasets, such as rice leaf images or weather data.



Model Training: Provides pre-trained models and scripts to train custom models for disease and pest prediction.



User-Friendly Interface: A simple interface for farmers to input data and receive predictions.



Open-Source: Licensed under the MIT License for collaboration and further development.
